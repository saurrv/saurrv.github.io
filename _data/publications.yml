  description: "Appropriate tagging of images is at the heart of efficient recommendation and retrieval and is used for indexing image content. Existing technologies in image tagging either focus on what the image contains based on a visual analysis or utilize the tags from the textual content accompanying the images as the image tags. While the former is insufficient to get a complete understanding of how the image is perceived and used in various context, the latter results in a lot of irrelevant tags particularly when the accompanying text is large. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on graph-based random walk that extracts only image-relevant tags from the accompanying text. We perform detailed evaluation of our scheme by checking its viability using human annotators as well as by comparing with state-of-the art algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms base-line algorithms with respect to different metrics."
