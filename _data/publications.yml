  description: "Appropriate tagging of images is at the heart of efficient recommendation and retrieval and is commonly used with search engines and content management systems for indexing image content. However, existing technologies in image tagging focuses on what the content contains than how it is perceived. However, for a practical utilization of these tags, it is paramount to understand the usage of the image and incorporate them with the tags for better retrieval and recommendation. In places where the usage of the content is captured from the associated content, little is done to semantically connect the textual and visual content for a homogeneous tag representation. In this work we propose a system that analyzes the usage of an image and utilizes the information thus obtained to enhance the image tags."
