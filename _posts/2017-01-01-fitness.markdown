<p>"Just a bit more! Push harder! No more fat!" With new year round the corner, fitness resolutions are on your mind. With this post, I want to share my experience and motivate my smart readers to get started. You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.</p>

<p>Muscular limits to human body have still not been discovered. The basic necessities only include thirst, hunger, sleep and sexual desires. The best references I found were <a href="http://scientificbrains.com/3-scientific-facts-that-prove-that-muscular-limits-is-purely-psychological/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.mountrantmore.com/rants/the-limitations-of-the-human-body/">this</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Can you please reiterate your excuse?</blockquote>

<p>A well-built physique is much more than just good looks. It is a status symbol. A healthy frame reflects hard work and discipline. You cannot buy it, cannot inherit it, cannot borrow nor steal, you have to earn it. It exhibits self-respect, patience and dignity.</p>

<p>So, what have you done? I finished 6-week shredded program by Guru Mann and lost more than 7 kg in 6 weeks. I got results which I could not get in years. My personal experience with Guru Mann fitness has been totally amazing. I was supplied with all the information I needed and was challenged to train weaker muscles which are usually ignored, for an overall definition. Some examples of such muscles include rear delts, Brachialis, Serratus, Intercostal and many more. The only thing which could have been improved was my concentration. With immense gratitude, I dedicate my results to Guru Mann.</p>
