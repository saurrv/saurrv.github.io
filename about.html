<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I am a Computer Science Senior Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.</p>

<p>My Computer Science interests lie in Theory, Algorithms and Machine Learning. Besides, Economics and Business insights, fascinate me the most.</p>

<p>I am equipped with both professional research and development experience in reputed global firms. Regularly participate in programming and mathematical contests that test knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I have had a love affair with problem solving since a tender age. The best time of my life has been spent solving problems.</p>

<p>I love to drown myself in the ocean of music. A passion for cooking and adventures enslaves me. Last few weeks have been spent building some more muscles. As you might have guessed, I like to liven up what I write.</p>

<p>In the end, I am a progressive guy interested in meeting new opportunities and positive people. My goal in life is to learn, grow and repeat.</p>
