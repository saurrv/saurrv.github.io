<p>Determined to reach the zenith and brave enough to take action.</p>

<p>Presently, I contribute to Finance Platform of Uber as a Software Engineer. Recently graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee. My Computer Science interests lie in Theory and Artificial Intelligence. Besides, Economics and Business, fascinate me the most.</p>

<p>My love affair with problem solving started at a tender age and since then, the best time of my life has been spent solving problems.</p>

<p>For me, music is not a hobby, it is a need. A passion for adventures enslaves me, every time. As you might have guessed, I love to liven up what I write. Want to play football? I am in.</p>

<p>My goal in life is to wake up with gratitude, work hard with passion and commitment, kick ass at what I do and repeat. I like to be around people who can make me feel dumb, stupid or both.</p>
