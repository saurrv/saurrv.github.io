<p>Determined to reach the top and brave enough to take action. Yes, that is me.</p>

<p>Presently, I contribute to Business Platform of Uber as a Software Engineer. Recently graduated from IIT Roorkee in Computer Science in 2017. My Computer Science interests lie in Theory, Algorithms and Machine Learning. Besides, Economics and Business insights, fascinate me the most.</p>

<p>I have had a love affair with problem solving since a tender age. The best time of my life has been spent solving problems. Regularly participate in programming and mathematical contests that test knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Now, I spend most of my free time learning to build scalable and usable systems. As a hobbyist, I learn about personal finance and investments.</p>

<p>I love to drown myself in the ocean of music. A passion for cooking and adventures enslaves me. Disciplined, both inside and outside the gym, because of major fitness goals. As you might have guessed, I love to liven up what I write. Want to play football? I am in.</p>

<p>In the end, I am a progressive guy interested in meeting new opportunities and positive people. My goal in life is to learn, grow and repeat. I like to be around people who can make me feel dumb, stupid or both.</p>
